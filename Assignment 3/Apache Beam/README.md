Assignment 3.3 - Apache Beam features

1. learned how to set up and install apache beam on local machine
2. tutorial with the word count program that uses a pipeline to count the words in a txt. (equivalant of 'Hello World' program in Apache Beam)
3. Used the provided the link to learn how to write a composite transform. The example 3 of composite transform wouldn't work initially, until I found out that in the given function filter_on_count is filtering counts above 1, but the given data was not enough data to do >1. So i changed it to >0. The composite transform works now.
