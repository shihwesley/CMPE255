Hello

This is the Git Repo for CMPE255 Assignment 3 includes EDA, Auto EDA and Apache Beam.
Files : Sankey.js, strains.json, index.html (in the main folder)

The design was to show the correlation between emotional affects and medical purposes with the different type of cannabis strian.

This is an interactive visualization where you can choose the emotional affect or medical purpose that you want to experience/treat and show you what type of strains can give you that. Or if you click on one particular strain, it will show you its medical purpose that it can treat and emotional affect that you can experience.
